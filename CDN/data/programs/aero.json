    "description": "<p>With the introduction of jet technology by C7 Aerospace, a new era of atmospheric flight lies ahead.</p><p>Along with the Ascent Program, the Aero Program was created by the KAI at the dawn of the Institute to find real life application of jet engines.     Having the capability to reach previously impossible speed and performance in flight, the correct employment of this technology would be crucial for the KAI.<br />    High altitude experiments, exploration of difficult areas to reach on Kerbin, transportation of equipment and personnel in a small amount of time is just a portion     of what this technology can allow.    </p>  <p>     At the same time, there is a lot of interest in the military and civilian market around jets, and being the first to product reliable aircraft can be crucial for the Institute     to provide a source of revenue to fund additionally its programs. Similarly to Ascent, work on the Aero program started earlier than the foundation of KAI, in fact,     UKN engineers already had a collaboration with C7 for the development of a prototype jet plane, allowing for the transfer of all assets and knowledge to the KSC where the work continued.  </p>  <p>     Aero program goals are then multiple: exploit jet technologies and research around them while at the same time conduct atmospheric experiments for future planes development and gain profit by selling dedicated market variants of these.  </p>",
